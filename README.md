# dev_school_tg_bots
This repository shows my progress in completing the course from FICT Advisor. The course is aimed at learning the basics of the Python language and creating Python-based Telegram bots. This repository will show the code for the tasks I am performing. It will not show exactly my knowledge of the basics of the language. It will show my skills of solving logical problems in the form of code.
# tasks
Some assignments are taken from the CodeWars platform. I have attached a link to the assignment.
